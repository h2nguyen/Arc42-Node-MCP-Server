It bridges the gap between AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, Cline) and structured software architecture documentation, making it easy to create, maintain, and evolve comprehensive architecture docs with AI collaboration.\n\nThe core problem it solves: Creating and maintaining software architecture documentation is time-consuming and often neglected. This tool makes it effortless by enabling AI assistants to guide users through the arc42 documentation process, generate templates, track progress, and update sections collaboratively.\n\n## Target Users\n\n### Primary Users\n1. **Software Architects & Technical Leads** - Need to document system architecture for stakeholder communication, team onboarding, and decision tracking\n2. **Development Teams** - Need accessible architecture documentation that evolves with the codebase\n3. **AI Assistants (Claude, Cursor, Cline)** - The MCP tools enable AI to actively participate in documentation creation and maintenance\n\n### User Needs & Pain Points\n- **Pain**: Architecture docs become outdated quickly → **Solution**: AI-assisted updates make it easy to keep docs current\n- **Pain**: Starting documentation from scratch is daunting → **Solution**: Pre-built arc42 templates with guidance\n- **Pain**: Inconsistent documentation structure → **Solution**: Standardized 12-section arc42 format\n- **Pain**: Difficult to track documentation completeness → **Solution**: Built-in status tracking and progress monitoring\n\n## Key Features\n\n1. **arc42-workflow-guide**: Provides comprehensive guidance on using the arc42 template, explaining all 12 sections and best practices for AI-assisted documentation\n2. **arc42-init**: Initializes a complete arc42 documentation workspace with directory structure, templates for all sections, and configuration files\n3. **arc42-status**: Tracks documentation progress, showing completion status for each section and overall documentation health\n4. **generate-template**: Generates detailed, AI-optimized templates for any of the 12 arc42 sections with prompts and examples\n5. **update-section**: Updates content in specific arc42 sections with replace or append modes\n6. **get-section**: Retrieves current content from any arc42 section for review or further editing\n\n## Business Objectives\n\n- **Adoption**: Become a go-to tool for AI-assisted architecture documentation in the MCP ecosystem\n- **Quality**: Enable creation of professional-grade architecture documentation that meets industry standards\n- **Accessibility**: Make arc42 methodology accessible to teams who may not have formal architecture training\n- **Community**: Build an open-source community around AI-assisted documentation practices\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n- **NPM Downloads**: Measure adoption rate through weekly/monthly download statistics\n- **GitHub Stars/Forks**: Track community interest and engagement\n- **Issue Resolution Rate**: Maintain high responsiveness to user issues and feature requests\n- **Documentation Completeness**: Users successfully complete full arc42 documentation for their projects\n\n## Product Principles\n\n1. **AI-First Design**: Every tool is optimized for AI assistant usage with clear inputs, structured outputs, and helpful guidance text\n2. **Standards Compliance**: Faithfully implement the arc42 template while adapting it for AI workflows\n3. **Progressive Documentation**: Support iterative documentation - users don't need to complete everything at once\n4. **Minimal Friction**: Easy installation (npx, npm), simple configuration, works with popular AI tools out-of-the-box\n\n## Monitoring & Visibility\n\n- **Status Dashboard**: `arc42-status` tool provides real-time progress tracking across all 12 sections\n- **Completion Metrics**: Visual indicators of which sections are complete, in-progress, or pending\n- **File-Based Storage**: All documentation stored as Markdown files in standard directory structure for version control\n\n## Future Vision\n\n### Potential Enhancements\n- **Multi-Language Support**: Templates in languages beyond English (German, French, etc.)\n- **Template Variants**: Different arc42 template variants for different project types (microservices, monoliths, embedded systems)\n- **Diagram Generation**: AI-assisted generation of architecture diagrams (Mermaid, PlantUML) embedded in documentation\n- **Export Formats**: Support for exporting to PDF, HTML, Confluence, or other documentation platforms\n- **Validation Tools**: Automated checks for documentation completeness and consistency\n- **Team Collaboration**: Multi-user editing with conflict resolution for team documentation efforts\n- **CI/CD Integration**: Hooks for validating documentation as part of build pipelines\n",
