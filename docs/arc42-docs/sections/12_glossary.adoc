| *Architecture Documentation*
| Systematic description of a software system's structure, behavior, and design decisions to enable understanding and maintenance.

| *Architecture Decision Record (ADR)*
| A document capturing an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences.

| *Building Block*
| A logical or technical component of a system at any level of decomposition.

| *Quality Attribute*
| A measurable or testable property of a system used to indicate how well the system satisfies stakeholder needs. Also called non-functional requirement.

| *Stakeholder*
| Anyone with interest in or affected by the system - users, developers, operators, management, etc.

== Technical Terms

[cols="2,5", options="header"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| *MCP (Model Context Protocol)*
| An open protocol that standardizes how AI assistants connect with external data sources and tools. Enables AI systems to access contextual information safely.

| *MCP Server*
| A program that exposes tools and resources to MCP clients (AI assistants) via the Model Context Protocol.

| *MCP Client*
| An application (like Claude Desktop, Cursor, or Cline) that connects to MCP servers to use their tools and resources.

| *STDIO Transport*
| Communication method using standard input (stdin) and standard output (stdout) for process-to-process messaging.

| *Tool*
| In MCP context, a callable function that an AI assistant can invoke, defined with a schema for inputs and outputs.

| *Zod*
| A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library used to define and validate data structures at runtime.

| *AsciiDoc*
| A lightweight markup language for writing documentation. More feature-rich than Markdown, supporting includes, admonitions, and cross-references.

| *Asciidoctor*
| A text processor for converting AsciiDoc to HTML, PDF, EPUB, and other formats. The toolchain used for AsciiDoc processing.

| *PlantUML*
| An open-source tool that allows users to create diagrams from plain text language. Used for UML diagrams in documentation.

== Internationalization Terms

[cols="2,5", options="header"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| *Language Strategy*
| A design pattern implementation that encapsulates all localized content for a specific language, implementing the `LanguageStrategy` interface.

| *Language Registry*
| A central storage (using Registry Pattern) that holds all registered language strategies for O(1) lookup by language code.

| *Language Factory*
| A factory class that creates language strategy instances with code normalization and fallback support.

| *Language Code*
| A standardized identifier for a language (e.g., EN, DE, FR). In this project, uses uppercase 2-3 letter codes.

| *Localized Template Provider*
| A facade class that provides simplified access to localized templates, hiding the complexity of language selection.

| *Fallback Language*
| The default language (English) used when a requested language is not available or invalid.

| *Native Name*
| The name of a language in its own language (e.g., "Deutsch" for German, "中文" for Chinese).

| *i18n*
| Abbreviation for "internationalization" - the process of designing software so it can be adapted to various languages.

| *L10n*
| Abbreviation for "localization" - the process of adapting software for a specific language or region.
|===

== Output Format Terms

[cols="2,5", options="header"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| *Output Format Strategy*
| A design pattern implementation that handles format-specific syntax generation (headings, tables, code blocks) for Markdown or AsciiDoc.

| *Output Format Registry*
| A central storage that holds all registered output format strategies for O(1) lookup by format code.

| *Output Format Factory*
| A factory class that creates output format strategy instances with code normalization and alias support.

| *Output Format Code*
| A standardized identifier for an output format: `'markdown'` or `'asciidoc'`.

| *Format Template Plugin*
| A plugin interface that provides format-specific template content (section templates, workflow guide, README) for a specific language.

| *Language Strategy Factory*
| A factory module that creates LanguageStrategy instances using a plugin architecture for format dispatch.

| *Format Alias*
| Alternative names for format codes (e.g., `'md'` for `'markdown'`, `'adoc'` for `'asciidoc'`) that are normalized during processing.

| *Native Template*
| A template written directly in the target format (e.g., AsciiDoc), sourced from vendor arc42 templates, preserving format-specific features.
|===

== Project-Specific Terms

[cols="2,5", options="header"]
|===
| Term | Definition

| *Section*
| One of the 12 numbered parts of the arc42 template (e.g., "01_introduction_and_goals").

| *Workspace*
| The `arc42-docs/` directory created by the server to store architecture documentation files.

| *ToolContext*
| Internal data structure containing project path and workspace root for tool execution.

| *ToolResponse*
| Standardized response format from tool handlers, containing success status, message, and optional data.

| *targetFolder*
| Optional parameter allowing tools to operate on a specific directory instead of the default workspace.

| *config.yaml*
| YAML configuration file storing project metadata including name, version, language, format, and arc42 template reference.
